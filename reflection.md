Objective:

In this project, I was supposed to learn how to use while loops to create a repetitive game where players interact and make choices. Additionally, I was tasked with defining variables that would be used and referenced later in the code. The objective also focused on protecting against bad user input and ensuring that the program could handle various conditions effectively. Overall, I was to understand the process of creating a simple, functional game where logic and flow control are crucial.

Procedure:

The first step I followed was using feedback from my initial design to create a more polished algorithm. I went back to my notes from class, especially on while loops, functions, and flow control, to ensure I understood how to properly apply new concepts. I had used def main(): in the past but never really understood its purpose until now. The project allowed me to experiment with that function to structure the code properly. I also had to incorporate input validation, ensuring that user inputs were within the specified range, which required me to revisit functions like .lower() to handle various user responses.

Key Concepts:

Some key concepts explored were reading and interpreting flowcharts, applying what I learned in class, and making sure I received valid inputs from users. I also understood how specific parameters, like those in the .lower() function, make the code flow correctly based on user input. This project helped me practice decision-making in the program while ensuring a smooth user experience.

Results:

The results I achieved were generally what I expected. The program works and runs as designed, even though I know it could be optimized further to minimize the code. It handles errors well, such as invalid inputs, and ensures the game continues until a logical endpoint. I ran a few test cases, such as inputting extreme values (like trying to take 100 sticks), and the program redirected me to the correct prompt. It worked as expected, even if the implementation wasn’t the most efficient.

Reflection:

One challenge I faced was the constant errors at the beginning due to missing basic lines of code, which hindered the program’s ability to return values. The biggest difficulty was transferring what I wanted to do conceptually into actual code. However, I followed the three rules of programming by keeping the solution simple, focusing on error handling, and maintaining efficiency. I overcame the challenges by referring to my updated algorithm, flowcharts, and class notes, although the process was painstaking. A key takeaway is that while flowcharts are useful for visualizing the problem, they didn't help as much in writing the actual code. Overall, I definitely learned through struggle, which I believe is the most effective way to grasp new concepts.

Working alone felt satisfying because I had complete control over the project. I knew exactly where I was stuck and what needed to be fixed. Completing the project felt like watching a sand clock drip to the end—a gradual but rewarding process.
