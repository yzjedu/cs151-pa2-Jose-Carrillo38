### Comments on the grading
- If there are NOs in this FEEDBACK document, address it according to the description
- Although the story makes sense and it checks all the boxes, this doesn't look like an algorithm. This is more of a description. The indentation is lacking, and there are many things to be modified. Once you converted this description into an algorithm, you may be able to get an M. For now, you need to revise it
